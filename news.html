               <h3>The danger that rheumatic heart disease poses in Kenya</h3>
               <p>In Kenya, medics say the most common types of cardio vascular diseases are ischemic heart disease, which is caused by narrowing of the coronary arteries, decreasing blood supply to the heart and rheumatic heart disease, which is caused by damage to the heart valves. According to Mzee Ngunga, a cardiologist at Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi, ischemic heart disease is found mostly among the affluent, while the latter appears most prevalent in low-income populations. “We attribute ischemic heart disease to consumption of a high cholesterol diet and majority of patients suffering from this condition are Asians and Somalis aged between 50 and 60 years,” he says.<br>Dr Ngunga said majority of the patients who visit the Heart and Cancer Centre at Aga Khan Hospital are found to be suffering from this kind of heart disease. Things are however, very different at the Kenyatta National Hospital where Resident Cardiologist Bernard Gitura says rheumatic heart disease is the most common heart complication and cause of heart surgery at the hospital. According to Dr Gitura, rheumatic heart disease begins with a sore throat caused by the streptococcus virus, which if not effectively treated using antibiotics, causes rheumatic fever that begins to affect heart valves. The damaged heart valves narrow resulting in decreased blood flow or they may leak causing blood to flow in the wrong direction. Heart muscles could also be damaged, resulting in poor pumping function, or heart failure.</p>
